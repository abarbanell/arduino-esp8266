This is the project website for
[arduino-esp8266](https://github.com/abarbanell/arduino-esp8266),
a collection of small projects using the [ESP8266
Processor](http://www.esp8266.com/) for my IOT things.

*Standard Disclaimer:* You may learn something out of it, or you
may not. I make no warranties.

# First things first

In this post I want to create a minimal IOT device, it should be
capable of sending some messages to a internet server to show
connectivity.

## Shopping time

I got a ESP-01 board, an ESP8266 with the smallest set of connectors.
You can get it from eBay, Aliexpress, and many other places.
I got mine from
[tindie](https://www.tindie.com/products/AprilBrother/esp8266-flasher-rev2/),
bundled with a Flasher which makes it
easy to just plug your ESP-01 into the flasher and connect the
flasher via USB with your computer to push the code down.

*Beware:* the ESP-8266 works with 3.3V power, if you connect it to
5V directly it will probaly be killed. (I did not try this yet).
Using the flasher will take care of the power conversion during the
programming, but if you run your ESP8266 later without the flasher you need to take
care of the right power. We will get into the details later.

This is the bare minimum required to run your ESP-8266.

## IDE setup

I use  Ubuntu linux box for my developemnt, but it is very similar on MacOS or Windows.

First install the Arduino IDE (currently 1.6.10) as described on the [Arduino
Website](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/HomePage) and specifically
for the IDE on different platforms:

- [Linux](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/Linux)
- [Windows](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/Windows)
- [Mac OS X](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/MacOSX)

Next you need to install the [ESP8266 tools for Arduino IDE](https://github.com/esp8266/Arduino) with 

- Open *Preferences* in the Arduino IDE
- Enter 
```
http://arduino.esp8266.com/stable/package_esp8266com_index.json
```
in the field for *Additional Boards Manager URLs*
- Open *Tools -> Boards -> Boards Manager* and install esp8266 
- Also in the *Boards* Menu, select the *Generic ESP8266 Module* as your board.

## This didn't work...

There seems to be an issue in the esp8266 flash tool used by this and
I had to apply
[this recipe](http://arduino.stackexchange.com/questions/20219/upload-with-esptool-fails-with-espcomm-send-command-cant-receive-slip-payload) to fix it.

# Push some code

My first program for the ESP8266 should just send some message to
show it is alive. I have chosen thingspeak.com as receiver because
it was easy to set up. The program below will send a message containing
the hostname and the time since last boot (in milliseconds), you
need to:

- register an account on www.thingspeak.com
- create a channel and configure the first input field with a name
of "Uptime [ms]"or similar - it is just a name for display purposes.
![ts channel]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/2016/08/ts-new-channel.png)
- note your write API KEY and channel number and fill into the code below.
- note down your WIFI SSID and password to connect to your WiFi
router. Also to be filled into the program below.

The code is available on github [abarbanell/arduino-esp8266](https://github.com/abarbanell/arduino-esp8266/blob/master/sketch_uptime_thingspeak/sketch_uptime_thingspeak.ino).

# Results

With this you can see the data sent to thingspeak.com
[here](https://thingspeak.com/channels/145240). On this site you can
then analyze the data with Matlab code and visualizations.

So my "thing" is up and running and now we can look at more complex tasks
in the next posts.

Let me know in the comment if you have any questions, suggestions or
corrections.
