# Sending Data to my "Limitless Garden" IOT backend	

We have set up our environment for ESP8266 development with the
Arduino IDE in a [previous
post](http://blog.abarbanell.de/arduino-esp8266/iot/setup/) it is
time to connect to my own IOT backend.

I have switched to a more conveniend NodeMCU type board because it is
the simplest hardware setup you could find - no power supply, no separate 
flasher, just a simple usb plug from your development PC (in my case Ubuntu
Linux) to the ESP8266 board. The esp8266 can be plugged into a breadboard, 
but is a bit too wide for a normal size breadboard. I have just joined 
two half-size breadboards side-by-side and it looks like this:

# Server side overview
A more detailed explanation of the "Limitless Garden" and how it
got its name is already online
[here](http://blog.abarbanell.de/raspberry/2015/12/30/monitoring-iot-backend).
The short story is that you can post any JSON data to any data collection with 
the call to 

```
POST <your limitless garden server>/api/collections/<your collection name>?user_key=<your API key>
```

My instance runs at https:lg.dokku.abarbanell.de and is protected with the 
following methods:

- encryption with https
- authetication for the website with Google ID (anybody can login and view data, 
but some update operations are only for privileged users)
- API is protected with a API_KEY from [3scale.com](www.3scale.com)
